Hi Luke!

So who are you? (btw can Windows people see this file with the ? in the name?) -- No. -- I can see the file but not the ?.

I'm Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. I'm looking for Ciri, a yong Ashen-Haired woman. Have you seen her?

I played Gwent with a woman of your description yesterday.

Where did she go?

Rode off with a masked man.

The mysterious Elf. I need to tell Yennefer about this.
